# Large-Pre-Trained-Models-for-Multi-Modal-Reasoning-with-Knowledge-Graph
This project explores the integration of graph-based foundation models (e.g., knowledge graphs) with large language models (LLMs) to build AI systems capable of reasoning across diverse scientific data modalities.

#### Developing large pre-trained models for multi-modal reasoning to enhance understanding of genetic risks and underlying causes of complex illnesses, with the goal of early intervention and precision medicine.  The correlation between genotypes and the majority of phenotypes is complicated, and despite the existence of several databases, genome-wide association studies often account for just a minor portion of most features. These interactions are complex, implied, and challenging to mathematically represent, and they remain unexplored for illness risk forecasting.   To accurately predict illness risk and understand the nature of complex illnesses, we must dissect these delicate associations and disease interactions.  The polygenic risk score (PRS) is a method for evaluating genetic risks for complex illnesses.  Traditional PRS methods, which often have a linear form, frequently fail to capture the intricate interactions between genotype and phenotype. Computational disease gene prediction enhances thorough experimental testing  and speeds up the discovery of actual illness-associated genes.
